#Introduction 
The authors of this paper were interested in seeing which genes were lost in the evolution of
animals. To do this they compared the genomes of closely related eukaryotes, such as yeast and
choanoflagellates, to animals and found that twenty-four genetic functions retained in lower order
eukaryotes but lost in animals. Most interestingly, they found two powerful molecular chaperones,
Hsp78 and Hsp104, were abruptly lost during the evolution of unicellular organisms to animals. It
is not clear why this occurred, but the authors suggest the loss of shared clients of Hsp78 and
Hsp104 played a role.

**Twenty-five genetic functions undetectable in animals.**
